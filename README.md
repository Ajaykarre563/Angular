# Angular

Angular is a popular web development framework created by Google. It is used to build dynamic, single-page web applications (SPAs) using HTML, CSS, and TypeScript (a superset of JavaScript).

üîç Key Points:
Framework: Not just a library‚ÄîAngular gives you everything you need (routing, HTTP, forms, etc.) in one package.

Component-based: Your UI is built using reusable components.

Two-way data binding: Syncs the data between the UI and the logic automatically.

TypeScript support: Angular apps are written in TypeScript, which helps catch errors early.

‚úÖ Example Use Cases:
Admin dashboards

E-commerce sites

Real-time data apps (like chats or dashboards)
